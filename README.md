Module 1 projects on the Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development.
===================================================================================
The first Project is an autobiography page in html with css styling and javascript functionality.

  a) The main branch will include the initial website.
  b) On the user branch I will modify the website to make it personal and add the javascript functionality.

  ===================================================================================
  The file "autobiography_example_start.html" is the starting point for this exercise. From the initial state of the file, I am going to modify its content. These are the steps I am following:
 1- I write detailed information about myself in the autobiography file.
 2- I add css styles for the display of the <div> elements.
 3- I add the bootdev_python_certificate.
 4- I add JavaScript functionality. I add a Like button with a counter.
